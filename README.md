Project Description

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Requirements

The only requirement of this application is the Node Package Manager. All other dependencies can be installed with:

```
npm install
```

### Basic Configuration

This app uses Webpack which takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. In order for your app to render you will need to first bundle your modules using the following command:

```
npm run build
```

If there are additional steps, add them below:

```
FILL_ME_IN
```

You will also have to set your environment variables before FILL_ME_IN. You can do this by running the following command(s) in the terminal:

```
export FILL_ME_IN=FILL_ME_IN
```

Ensure that your environment variable(s) have been set correctly by running the following command(s):

```
echo $FILL_ME_IN
```

The console should print out the environment variable you just exported. 

### Running the App

Initalize your server:

```
npm start
```

## Testing

```
npm test
```
